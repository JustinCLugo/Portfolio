    <p>I got into video editing two years during grade 11 of highschool.</p>
    <p>At a time of covid where free time exists more due to school being online, I found myself editing clips of my Valorant gameplay through the use of learning basics on Premiere pro. Then finding out how to use After Effects.</p>
    <p>Overtime I found that my passion as an editor expanded to my dream of one day becoming a Content Creator/Streamer</p>
