    <p>I probably dont look like it, but funny enough I do play sports especially volleyball. I started my volleyball journey three years ago in grade 10 highschool.</p>
    <p>During covid times, my friends and I had watched the Volleyball Nation League which inspired us to start playing.</p>
    <p>We then bought a outdoor net and started our journeys from there. Leading us to different variations of volleyball such as outdoor, recreational and even beach.</p>

    <h2>"Favourite Players"</h2>
    <p>This is for anyone interested in the players that inspire me to keep playing volleyball. Within each basic position</p>
